# AdventureWorks_PowerBIproject
This Project Case is part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence Course on Udemy online platform by Maven Analytics. In this case, I am being put in the point of view of a Business Intelligence Analyst in AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that runs cycling equipment and accessories production. The Management Team needs a way to track the KPI, monitor and compare the performance, and identify some insights, as well as high value customers. The project involved connecting and transforming raw data, building a relational data model, and creating calculated columns and measures with 
DAX. I also created a rolling calendar using PowerQuery M and designed an interactive dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales, 
revenue, profit, and customer insights, allowing for analysis across different regions and product trends.

# Objectives:
1. Connect and transform the raw data
2. Build a relational data model
3. Create calculated columns and measures with DAX (Data Analysis expression)
4. Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
